title: "19 Coding Websites for Kids: Elementary, Middle, and High School Students"
---
We’ve all know that we need to teach kids to code.

We’re surrounded by tech. Our children need to understand how tech works so that they are more than just consumers of technology. And, coding is where the jobs will be.

But the question remains, how to make sure our children learn coding.

One path is to use a website that teaches kids to code, but which one?

Here’s an age wise list of sites that teach kids to code. These 19 coding websites for kids are organized by age. The list includes both paid and free resources to give you some ideas.

1. Blockly
https://blockly-games.appspot.com/
For ages 8+. Free.

Blockly teaches programming principles and introduces JavaScript using a block-based programming approach.

teach kids to codePuzzle pieces appear on the screen. Each puzzle piece represents a block of code, which is kind of like a paragraph in a story. The child drags-and-drops the puzzle pieces to create a sequence of code to complete the “story” that makes up the software program. Then the child runs the program and sees the results, which can be an animation of a person moving through a maze or a bird flying toward its nest.

Blockly’s games require the child be able to read. Some of the games include using the number of degrees to define the direction an object moves. So, it’s not for really little kids despite it using a gamification approach and simple graphics.

Overall, Blockly is designed for children who don’t have any experience with coding. It’s aim is to make them ready to learn conventional text-based computer programming languages.

2. Code Combat
https://codecombat.com/
For ages 5-17. Core levels are free. Monthly subscription for additional levels.


Code Combat is an online game that teaches Python and/or JavaScript coding using text-based programming.

Kids play through different levels of an RPG (role playing game), learning the Python or JavaScript programming language along the way.

The first world that players visit is called Dungeons of Kithgard. The hero is a Medieval warrior called Anya. The player directs Anya down a path toward a gem and away from the spikes along the way in the first game. The player tells Anya where to go by typing lines of code into the screen, and  then running the program.

After successfully completing a level, the player moves up to more complex tasks and coding. Once all the challenges are completed in this world, the player moves on to another world and a new, more complicated set of challenges.

Code Combat requires the player to be able to read and type, though some code can be chosen by clicking on it in a drop-down menu.

Code Combat developers help teachers use it in their classrooms by providing course guides and wikis. They also promise a Course-in-a-Box containing a semester’s course content.

3. Code Monkey 
https://www.playcodemonkey.com/
For ages 9+. Annual subscription fee.

codemonkeyCode Monkey teaches computer program through online games. Starting with helping a monkey gather bananas, the player works through a series of challenges and eventually learns enough code to be able to build his or her own game.Using a text-based editor, the player learns CoffeeScript, a language that uses a syntax that is similar to written English but compiles into JavaScript.

The teacher’s subscription includes access to 32 lesson plans, three challenge workshops, and access to an online Google group.

4. Code.org Studio
https://studio.code.org/
For ages 4-14. Free.

Code.org Studio presents a series of four courses that teach computer science fundamentals. At the end of each course, students are able to create interactive games or stories for sharing online.

Each course is made up of a series of puzzles, videos, and activities that teach the principles behind computer science. Course 1 is for early readers (age 4-6) and can be skipped if your child is already reading proficiently.

Even though the later courses use the block-based approach for programming activities, students can choose to see the text-based code that is generated. Taken together, this series of four courses make up a curriculum that has been organized for use in the classroom and is aligned with ISTE standards

13. Thimble by Mozilla
https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US/
For ages 13+. Free.

thimble
Thimble by Mozilla is an online code editor for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Kids learn by doing on Thimble. Lessons are organized into projects. The kids choose between starting a new project or remixing (i.e., making changes to) an existing project.

Once in the project, the screen is split horizontally showing both a preview of the webpage and the code behind it. As the kids update the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code, they see its effect in the preview screen for the web page. This is the process used to demonstrate how the code works. Projects can also be previewed as they would appear on a desktop screen or a smartphone, adding the concept of responsiveness to the experience. Once complete, a project can be shared online.

Canned remix projects have tutorials embedded in them. Kids can toggle the screen between the project and a tutorial for these project remixes. Otherwise, there is just single FAQ page available as help.

17. Code Wars
https://www.codewars.com/
For ages 14+. Free.

codewars
Code Wars challenges trained coders to pursue mastery by completing coding challenges that are delivered online. Coding challenges are available for CoffeeScript, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Clojure, Haskell, and C# (Csharp).

In an approach based on the Japanese martial arts practice of kata, the first step in Code Wars is to choose a language and prove your skills. Based on this initial challenge, the coder is ranked and given a challenge. The challenges get progressively more difficult. Coder gains Honor points for each challenge that she successfully completes. Once the coder earns enough honor points, the coder moves a level up.

Once a challenge is successfully completed, the coder has the access to the solutions of other coders who’ve completed the same challenge. By studying other people’s approach, the coder gets new insight into how the code works.

18. Khan Academy – Computer Programming https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming
Ages 13+. Free.

khan
Khan Academy – Computer Programming has courses in JavaScript, ProcessingJS, HTML & CSS, HTML & JavaScript and SQL.

Each of these courses presents a comprehensive introduction aimed at building a base for professional level skills. There’s also a section called “Meet the Professional” which contains interviews with 11 computer programmers from around the world working in a variety of industries.

Normally Khan Academy presents its courses via video. For its programming courses it uses “talk-throughs” which are more interactive than a normal video. With a talk-through the student can pause the video and “play” with the code listed on the screen. Talk-throughs are followed by step-by-step coding challenges and projects, both designed as coding practice. Finally, there’s a community programs area (i.e., online forum) where students can share projects, leave comments, and ask questions.

Khan Academy estimates each course will take between 15 and 40 hours to complete. The computer programming courses are most appropriate for high school students and adults, but a tech savvy middle schooler could probably work through them with some mentoring.

19. Vidcode

For ages 11+. Limited free access. Tiered annual subscriptions.

vidcode-horizontal-logo-3-27
Vidcode is a video coding platform aimed primarily at teen girls who want to learn how to code.

Using JavaScript, students learn coding as they produce videos and motion graphics. As they work, students see a thumbnail of the video and code behind it side-by-side. As they make changes to the code they can see the effect in the thumbnail. Once done, video projects can be shared in the Vidcode online community or via social media.

Free access to Vidcode gives access to the software, some beginner tutorials, and an online community. Tiered for-pay annual subscriptions also give access to projects, lesson plans, and curriculum.

As you can see there are many options if you are looking for websites that teach kids to code using a self-study mode. Depending on your child’s age and interests, you can choose which one to start with.
